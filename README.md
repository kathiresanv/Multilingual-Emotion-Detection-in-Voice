## Multilingual Emotion Detection in Voice

This project focuses on detecting emotions from speech audio samples in multiple languages using machine learning and audio signal processing techniques. It is designed to help build systems that understand human emotions from voice input, applicable in areas like virtual assistants, call center analysis, and mental health monitoring.

### 🎯 Objective

To develop a model that can accurately detect emotional states (such as happy, sad, angry, etc.) from voice recordings in different languages.

---

### 🧠 Key Features

* Multilingual support for emotion detection
* Preprocessing of audio files using MFCCs or spectrograms
* Model training with labeled emotional speech datasets
* Visualization of emotion predictions
* Support for custom or benchmark datasets (e.g., RAVDESS, EMO-DB)

---

### 🧰 Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **Librosa** – for audio processing
* **scikit-learn / TensorFlow / PyTorch** – for model development
* **NumPy / Matplotlib / Seaborn** – for analysis and visualization

### 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/emotion-detection-voice.git
   cd emotion-detection-voice
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Use `pip` to install required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Notebook**

   Launch Jupyter and open `multilingual_emotion_detection_in_voice.ipynb`.

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

---

### 🧪 Example Usage

Upload audio files into the `datasets/` folder and run the notebook to:

* Extract features (MFCCs, chroma, mel)
* Train/test emotion detection models
* Output predicted emotion labels

---

### 🌍 Supported Emotions

Typical emotions included (varies by dataset):

* 😠 Angry
* 😢 Sad
* 😀 Happy
* 😐 Neutral
* 😨 Fearful
* 😲 Surprised

### ✅ To-Do

* [ ] Add real-time microphone input
* [ ] Expand language coverage
* [ ] Deploy model as a REST API or web app
